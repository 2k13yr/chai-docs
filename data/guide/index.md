  title: Getting Started Guide
---

Start with the basics. 

- [Install Chai](/guide/installation/) in your environment.
- [Learn about styles](/guide/styles/) that you can use to define tests.

And then move on to the more advanced topics.

- Build your own plugins (coming soon)

And if you get stuck, you can always [find help](/guide/resources/).
